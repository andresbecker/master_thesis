%% Example:
%\usepackage{tikz}
%\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{multirow}
\usepackage{calc} % allows for easy manipulation of length arithmetic
\usepackage{longtable} % allow crating tables using more than one page
% xcolor was already in tumcolors2 but because of the order https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/83101/option-clash-for-package-xcolor there was an error, therefore, it was moved at the beginning of tumthesis.cls
%\usepackage[table]{xcolor}% To color table cells, http://ctan.org/pkg/xcolor
