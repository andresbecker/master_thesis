In this chapter we will describe the models used to predict transcription rate, as well as their experimental setups. We will also provide the experimental setups for the interpretability methods\fxnote{Consider adding here also the justification for the number the steps $m$ in the Riemann sum.}.

Hannah's recommendations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Give implementation details and hyperparameters
\end{itemize}
