This part should contain:
\begin{itemize}
  \item An overview of this chapter
  \item A diagram showing the pipeline: Preprocessing -> TDFS -> CNN
\end{itemize}

In this chapter we will describe the models used to predict transcription rate, as well as their experimental setups. We will also provide the experimental setups for the interpretability methods.

Hannah's recommendations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Give implementation details and hyperparameters
\end{itemize}
