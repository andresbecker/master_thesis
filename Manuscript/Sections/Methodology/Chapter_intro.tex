This chapter provides the experimental setups for each element of the workflow shown in figure \ref{fig:meth:pipeline}. This includes the raw data processing (selected raw data and the quality control), the \gls{tfds} parameters, the data augmentation techniques (as well as their hyperparameters), the used models (architecture, loss function, optimizer and hyperparameters), the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models and the hyperparameters corresponding to the interpretability methods.
