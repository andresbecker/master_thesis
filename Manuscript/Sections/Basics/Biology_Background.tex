To understand gene expression, is important to understanding how mRNA concentration in eukaryotes cells is regulated. These concentrations can vary depending on the synthesis and/or degradation rates, and the rapidity of the transition to a new concentration depends on the regulation of mRNA stability [1].


Gene expression is the process in which the instructions in our DNA are converted into a functional product such as proteins, which dictate cell function. Therefore, the thousands of genes expressed in a particular cell determine what that cell can do. 

There are two key steps involved in making (synthesize) a protein, Transcription and Translation. Roughly speaking, Transcription is the process in which the instructions to synthesize a protein are copied from the DNA inside the nucleus, to a single strand molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) that can come out of the nucleus and travel to the Ribosome. On the other hand, Translation is the process in which the protein is synthesized on the Ribosome following the instructions encoded in the mRNA.
