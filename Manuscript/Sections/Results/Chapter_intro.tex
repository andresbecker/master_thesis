A small overview. Explain roughly the pipline: Preprocessing -> TDFS -> CNN -> VatGrad IG -> ROAR

Hannah's recommendations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Results for each method/model in subsection
  \item Discuss results; what does this mean? Does this prove your hypothesis? Disprove it?
  \item Ideally final paragraph connecting different results
\end{itemize}
