If we assume that there is no information in the training data $\bs{X}_\text{train}$ that can be used to explain the independent variable $y$ (i.e. the \gls{tr}), then a model $f$ should not be able to make (learn) a better predictions than the average of the target values in the training set, i,e,

\begin{equation}
  f(\bs{x}_i)=\bar{y}_\text{train}
  \label{eq:results:metric_bl:ybar}
\end{equation}

\noindent for all $\bs{x}_i \in \bs{X}_\text{train}$ and where $\bar{y}_\text{train}=\frac{1}{N_\text{train}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_\text{train}}y_i$.

This idea is similar to the \hl{Coefficient of determination} $R^2$, which represents how much of the variance in the target variable $y$ is explained by the model when compared to $\bar{y}$.
Thus, a model that always returns $\bar{y}$, will have a $R^2=0$. On the other hand, if the model gives better predictions than $\bar{y}$, then $0 < R^2 \leq 1$, otherwise $R^2 < 0$.

Table \ref{table:results:metric_bl_vals} shows the value of the performance measures (baseline values) (see section \ref{sec:methodology:metrics}), when they are evaluated in the test set assuming that equation \ref{eq:results:metric_bl:ybar} holds.

As we already mentioned, the objective of this work is to explain cell expression using spatial information in multichannel images of cell nucleus.
Therefore, it is important to estimate how much information related with the pixel intensities (color information) remains in the data after preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
Since the linear model cannot take advantage of spatial information, we can use the performance of the linear model and the information in table \ref{table:results:metric_bl_vals} to estimate this.
Then, if the linear model can reach a lower value in the loss function than the one shown in the table \ref{table:results:metric_bl_vals}, this means that there is still color information in the data that can be used to predict the \gls{tr}.

On the other hand, we can also use the information provided in table \ref{table:results:metric_bl_vals} to validate whether the \glspl{cnn} are capable of predicting the \gls{tr} based only on spatial information.
