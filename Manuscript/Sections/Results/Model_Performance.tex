In this section we show the results of each model in terms of \gls{tr} prediction. In addition, we provide reference values that validate that the models are capable of learning something meaningful from the data.
At the end of the section we compare the validation errors between the models and reference values.

The models were trained in the high performance computing cluster of the Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ¼nchen.
The training jobs were allocated in the cluster by means of a job scheduling system (\hl{Slurm} \footnote{Slurm is an open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system for Linux clusters. For more information, please refer to the \href{https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html}{official documentation}.}), which a assigned the job to a node with a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU (either with 16 or 32 GB of dedicated ram memory.).
