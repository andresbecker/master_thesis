Road map. This must be addressed in this section:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Raw data preparation
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Briefly explain how the data is given; file format, metadata, etc.
    \item Speak about the quality control (discrimination of border, mitotic cells, etc.)
    \item Speak about the transformation from files to images, only mention the script used and add an entrance in the appendix.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Data Preprocessing
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Preprocessing techniques; clipping and standardization
    \item Creation of the Dataset, just mention that TFDS is used and add an entrance into the Appendix
    \item Also mention here the other preprocessing techniques tried.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The data preprocessing consist mainly of 4 steps

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The raw data processing, where raw files are converted into images.
  \item The quality control, where cells that are not useful for analysis are discarded.
  \item The creation of the dataset, where data is spitted into \hl{Train, validation} and \hl{Test} sets and stored in a way that can be used for model training efficiently.
  \item The image preprocessing, where the images are prepared before training the model (clipping and standardization).
\end{enumerate}

In this section we explain these 4 steps. However, the implementation is discussed in the sections \ref{sec:appendix:raw_data} (for steps 1 and 2) and \ref{sec:appendix:tfds} (for steps 3 and 4).

\subsubsection{Raw data processing}

As we mentioned in section \ref{sec:dataset:multiplexed_protein_maps}, the \gls{mpm} protocol is applied over section of cell cultures called \hl{wells}. The \gls{mpm} protocol will return several files for each well, containing the nuclear protein readouts of single cells, information from the subsequent analysis made to the intensities of the protein readouts, as well as information about the \gls{mpm} protocol experimental setup. We do not go into details about this files and how to transform them into multichannel images of single cell nucleus. However, a brief explanation of this can be found in the appendix \ref{sec:appendix:raw_data}. Appendix \ref{sec:appendix:raw_data} also show how to run the Python script that transforms the raw data into images, along with an explanation of the required parameters.

The Python script introduced on appendix \ref{sec:appendix:raw_data} extract the protein readouts from the raw data files, and use them to build multichannel images containing the nucleus of a single cell (see figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell:nucleus}). This means that during the reconstruction of the images, it is necessary to add black pixels (zeros) in the places where no measures were taken (like in the low corner of figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell:nucleus}). However, as we saw on section \ref{sec:basics:CNN}, in order to train a \gls{cnn} model, all the cell images need to have a fixed size. For this reason, after the image is reconstructed, it is necessary to add zeros to the images borders (zero-padding) in order to make it squared and of a fixed size (see figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell:nucleus_pad}). Finally, for each single cell nucleus, a \hl{cell mask} is created to keep track of the measured and non-measured pixels (see figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell:cell_mask}).

  \label{fig:data_pp:sample_cell}
\end{figure}

The raw data processing script saves in a specified directory files containing 3 compressed NumPy arrays; 1) the multichannel image (figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell:nucleus_pad}), a 3D array contains the protein readouts of the nucleus of a single cell 2) the cell mask (figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell:cell_mask}), a 2D array that indicates the measured pixels by the \gls{mpm} protocol (ones on the measured $x$ and $y$ coordinates and zeros otherwise) and 3) the channels average, a 1D array containing the average of the measured pixels per channel/protein. Each file is named using the unique id assigned to each single cell nucleus (\texttt{mapobject\_id\_cell}). The script also returns a \texttt{csv} file\footnote{This \texttt{csv} file can be easily opened as a \hl{Pandas DataFrame}. For more information, please refer to the \href{https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html}{official documentation}.} containing the metadata of each single cell from every processed well (one row per cell and one column per cell feature). Table \ref{table:dataset:metadata} shows the metadata columns that were relevant for this work.

\subsubsection{Quality Control}

During the transformation from raw data into images, cells that does not pass a quality control are discriminated. This quality control consist on avoiding cells that holds at least one of the following conditions
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The cell is in mitotic phase (i.e. on metadata, either \texttt{is\_polynuclei\_HeLa} or \texttt{is\_polynuclei\_184A1} is equal to 1 or \texttt{cell\_cycle} is \texttt{NaN}).
  \item The cell is in the border of the plate, well or site (i.e. on metadata, \texttt{is\_border\_cell} is equal to 1).
\end{enumerate}

The quality control is performed by the same script that transforms the raw data into multichannel images. Its implementation and execution, as well as an explanation of the required parameters, can be found on appendix \ref{sec:appendix:raw_data}.

\subsubsection{Dataset creation}

After the raw data from all wells were processed, and mitotic and/or border cells were eliminated (quality control), we are able to build a dataset\footnote{For this work we decided to use (and build) a custom \acrfull{tfds}, which is a subclass of \texttt{tensorflow\_datasets.core.DatasetBuilder} and allows to create a pipeline that can easily feed data into a machine learning model built using TensorFlow. For more information, please refer to the \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/add_dataset}{official documentation}.} that can be used efficiently to train models. We will not explain here how to create this dataset. However, a brief explanation of this can be found in the appendix \ref{sec:appendix:tfds}. Appendix \ref{sec:appendix:tfds} also show how to run the Python script that builds this dataset, along with an explanation of the required parameters.

Even though this script can bu used to build a dataset containing all available single cell images, for this work we created a dataset containing cells without pharmacological or metabolic perturbations (i.e. cells such that in the metadata \texttt{perturbation} is ether equal to \hl{normal} or \hl{DMSO}). Further more, during the creation of the dataset, it is possible to filter the image channels and select the target value from the channels average vector (which is stored along with each single cell image). In this case we kept all the input channels\footnote{The unnecessary/unwanted channels are removed during the model training/evaluation (see section \ref{sec:methodology:models}). The reason why this filtering is not made during the dataset creation, is to make the dataset set more robust (i.e. to avoid the need to create a new dataset each time the input channels of the image changed).}, except for the channel used to calculate the target value. This means that channel 35 was excluded (\texttt{00\_EU}\footnote{A brief description of this marker can be found on section \ref{sec:appendix:if_markers}.}), and entrance 35 from the channel average vector (interpreted as \gls{tr}) was selected as target value.

Last but not least, for each cell, its mask is added at the end as an extra channel to keep track of the measured pixels. The reason why the cell mask is stored as a channel, is because it will be needed by other process latter in the pipeline (some of the data augmentation techniques, see section \ref{sec:dataset:data_augmentation}). However, this (and other channels) are removed before the image is used to feed the model (during and after the training process, see section \ref{sec:methodology:models}).

Since we are dealing with cells in different phases (cell cycles), it is important that the distribution of the 3 phases is kept  in the train, validation and test sets\fxnote{Should I mention than half of the cells are in $G_1$ phase, which means that cell in $G_1$ phase apply more pressure on the optimization of the model parameters during training, while the cells in the $G_2$ phase will not? And/Or should I mention this in the conclusions as a future work?}. The same must happen with the proportion of cells without pharmacological/metabolic perturbation (\hl{Normal} cells) and control cells (\hl{DMSO} cells). Tables \ref{table:data_pp:dataset_dist_cc} and \ref{table:data_pp:dataset_dist_per} show respectively that these proportions are hold across the 3 sets.
