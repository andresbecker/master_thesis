\noindent The data preprocessing consist of 4 main steps

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The raw data processing, where raw files are converted into images.
  \item The quality control, where cells that are not useful for analysis are discarded.
  \item The creation of the dataset, where data is spitted into \hl{Train, validation} and \hl{Test} sets and stored in a way that can be used for model training efficiently.
  \item The image preprocessing, where the images are prepared before training the model (clipping and standardization).
\end{enumerate}

In this section we explain these 4 steps. However, the implementation is discussed in the sections \ref{sec:appendix:raw_data} (for steps 1 and 2) and \ref{sec:appendix:tfds} (for steps 3 and 4).

\subsection{Raw data processing}
\label{sec:dataset:data_pp:raw_data_p}

As we mentioned in section \ref{sec:dataset:multiplexed_protein_maps}, the \gls{mpm} protocol is applied over section of cell cultures called \hl{wells}. The \gls{mpm} protocol will return several files for each well, containing the nuclear protein readouts of single cells, information from the subsequent analysis made to the intensities of the protein readouts, as well as information about the \gls{mpm} protocol experimental setup. We do not go into details about this files and how to transform them into multichannel images of single cell nucleus. However, a brief explanation of this can be found in the appendix \ref{sec:appendix:raw_data}. Appendix \ref{sec:appendix:raw_data} also show how to run the Python script that transforms the raw data into images, along with an explanation of the required parameters.

The Python script introduced on appendix \ref{sec:appendix:raw_data} extract the protein readouts from the raw data files, and use them to build multichannel images containing the nucleus of a single cell (see figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell:nucleus}). This means that during the reconstruction of the images, it is necessary to add black pixels (zeros) in the places where no measures were taken (like in the low corner of figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell:nucleus}). However, as we saw on section \ref{sec:basics:CNN}, in order to train a \gls{cnn} model, all the cell images need to have a fixed size, which is denoted as $I_s$. For this reason, after the image is reconstructed, it is necessary to add zeros to the images borders (zero-padding) in order to make it squared and of a fixed size (see figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell:nucleus_pad}). Finally, for each single cell nucleus, a \hl{cell mask} is created to keep track of the measured and non-measured pixels (see figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell:cell_mask}). As we can see in figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell}, the cell nucleus is always located in the center of the image.

  \label{fig:data_pp:sample_cell}
\end{figure}

The raw data processing script saves in a specified directory files containing 3 compressed NumPy arrays; 1) the multichannel image (figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell:nucleus_pad}), a 3D array contains the protein readouts of the nucleus of a single cell 2) the cell mask (figure \ref{fig:data_pp:sample_cell:cell_mask}), a 2D array that indicates the measured pixels by the \gls{mpm} protocol (ones on the measured $x$ and $y$ coordinates and zeros otherwise) and 3) the channels average, a 1D array containing the average of the measured pixels per channel/protein. Each file is named using the unique id assigned to each single cell nucleus (\texttt{mapobject\_id\_cell}).
The script also returns a \texttt{csv} file\footnote{This \texttt{csv} file can be easily opened as a \hl{Pandas DataFrame}. For more information, please refer to the \href{https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html}{official documentation}.} containing the metadata of each single cell from every processed well (one row per cell and one column per cell feature). Table \ref{table:dataset:metadata} shows the metadata columns that were relevant for this work.

\subsection{Quality Control}
\label{sec:dataset:data_pp:qc}

During the transformation from raw data into images, cells that does not pass a quality control are discriminated. This quality control consist on avoiding cells that holds at least one of the following conditions
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The cell is in mitotic phase (i.e. on metadata, either \texttt{is\_polynuclei\_HeLa} or \texttt{is\_polynuclei\_184A1} is equal to 1 or \texttt{cell\_cycle} is \texttt{NaN}).
  \item The cell is in the border of the plate, well or site (i.e. on metadata, \texttt{is\_border\_cell} is equal to 1).
\end{enumerate}

The quality control is performed by the same script that transforms the raw data into multichannel images. Its implementation and execution, as well as an explanation of the required parameters, can be found on appendix \ref{sec:appendix:raw_data}.

\subsection{Dataset creation}
\label{sec:dataset:data_pp:dataset_creation}

After the raw data from all wells were processed, and mitotic and/or border cells were eliminated (quality control), we are able to build a dataset\footnote{For this work we decided to use (and build) a custom \acrfull{tfds}, which is a subclass of \texttt{tensorflow\_datasets.core.DatasetBuilder} and allows to create a pipeline that can easily feed data into a machine learning model built using TensorFlow. For more information, please refer to the \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/add_dataset}{official documentation}.} that can be used efficiently to train models. We will not explain here how to create this dataset. However, a brief explanation of this can be found in the appendix \ref{sec:appendix:tfds}. Appendix \ref{sec:appendix:tfds} also show how to run the Python script that builds this dataset, along with an explanation of the required parameters.

Even though this script can bu used to build a dataset containing all available single cell images, for this work we created a dataset containing cells without pharmacological or metabolic perturbations (i.e. cells such that in the metadata \texttt{perturbation} is ether equal to \hl{normal} or \hl{DMSO}). Further more, during the creation of the dataset, it is possible to filter the image channels and select the target value from the channels average vector (which is stored along with each single cell image). In this case we kept all the input channels\footnote{The unnecessary/unwanted channels are removed during the model training/evaluation (see section \ref{sec:methodology:models}). The reason why this filtering is not made during the dataset creation, is to make the dataset set more robust (i.e. to avoid the need to create a new dataset each time the input channels of the image changed).}, except for the channel used to calculate the target value. This means that channel 35 was excluded (\texttt{00\_EU}\footnote{A brief description of this marker can be found on section \ref{sec:appendix:if_markers}.}), and entrance 35 from the channel average vector (interpreted as \gls{tr}) was selected as target value.

Last but not least, for each cell, its mask is added at the end as an extra channel to keep track of the measured pixels. The reason why the cell mask is stored as a channel, is because it will be needed by other process latter in the pipeline (some of the data augmentation techniques, see section \ref{sec:dataset:data_augmentation}). However, this (and other channels) are removed before the image is used to feed the model (during and after the training process, see section \ref{sec:methodology:models}).

Table \ref{table:tfds_in:channels} (on appendix \ref{sec:appendix:tfds}) shows the image channels in the \gls{tfds}, including the name (column \hl{Channel name}) and identifier of each immunofluorescence markers (column \hl{Marker identifier}). Table \ref{table:tfds_in:channels} also shows the ids corresponding to the markers in the raw data (column \hl{Raw data id}) and in the \gls{tfds} (column \hl{TFDS id}). \hl{NA} means that the channel is not used/available either on the raw data or the \gls{tfds}.

Since we are dealing with cells in different phases (cell cycles), it is important that the distribution of the 3 phases is kept in the train, validation and test sets. The same must happen with the proportion of cells without pharmacological/metabolic perturbation (\hl{Normal} cells) and control cells (\hl{DMSO} cells). Tables \ref{table:data_pp:dataset_dist_cc} and \ref{table:data_pp:dataset_dist_per} show respectively that these proportions are hold across the 3 sets.

\subsection{Image preprocessing}

In this work we use \glspl{cnn} and images of cell nucleus to predict \gls{tr}. This means that there are two main features of the images that came into account when the model learns and predicts the \gls{tr}, the spatial distribution of the elements in the image and the intensity of the colors.
However, this work aims to explain and predict transcription based on the information encoded in the spatial distribution of proteins and organelles within the nucleus. Therefore, the image preprocessing techniques applied here should help mitigate the influence of color during training and prediction, so that the model can focus only on spatial information. For this reason, two preprocessing techniques are applied to each cell image, clipping and standardization. The clipping, as well as the standardization, are performed during the construction of the \gls{tfds}, which can be consulted in appendix \ref{sec:appendix:tfds}.

\subsubsection{Clipping}

The idea of clipping is to avoid extreme outliers to influence or leverage the model parameters during training. Figure \ref{fig:data_pp:outlier} gives an example of this. The blue line shows a model fitted including the outliers (the two dots on the right upper corner), while the orange line a model fitted without them.

% Figure created with notebook Preprocessing_resources.ipynb
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{outlier.jpg}
  \caption{Comparison between two linear regression models, fitted with (blue line) and without (orange line) outliers.}
  \label{fig:data_pp:outlier}
\end{figure}

To prevent high intense pixels to influence the model, we truncate/limit the value of pixels that are above a certain threshold. This threshold is different for each image channel and is determined using the cell images belonging to the training set. For each channel, the train images are loaded and the threshold is set as the $98\%$ percentile of the measured pixel intensities belonging to the channel. Then, using this threshold vector (one entrance per channel) all the images in the dataset (train, validation and test) are clipped. This is done before the data standardization. Finally, the clipping parameter (threshold) of each channel is stored in a metadata file, provided along with the \gls{tfds}. Figures \ref{fig:data_pp:pixel_dist:ori} and \ref{fig:data_pp:pixel_dist:clip} show the pixel intensity distribution of channel HDAC3 before and after clipping respectively.

\subsubsection{Standardization}

As we mentioned at the beginning of this section, to predict cell \gls{tr} we seek the model to rely on spatial information, rather than the intensity of the pixels. Therefore, to reduce pixel intensity influence, we apply per-channel standardization, which is just a shift and rescaling (a linear transformation) of the original data. Standardization is also called \hl{Z-score}, since the data is transformed using the mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ (normal distribution parameters) of a sample, as a shift and rescaling parameters respectively. As it is done in clipping, the standardization parameters are different for each channel and are computed using the images belonging to the training set. For all the measured pixels intensities in the \gls{tfds} (i.e. for train, validation and test sets), the standardization of pixel $i$ belonging to channel $c$ (i.e. $z_{i,c}$), is done as follow

\begin{equation}
  z_{i,c} = \frac{x_{i,c} - \mu_c}{\sigma_c}
  \label{eq:data_pp:z-score}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $x_{i,c}$ is the corresponding readout $i$ from channel $c$, and $\mu_c$, $\sigma_c$ are the mean and standard deviation (respectively) of channel $c$ computed using the training images.

The standardization centers the measured pixels of each channel around 0 (see figures \ref{fig:data_pp:pixel_dist:clip} and \ref{fig:data_pp:pixel_dist:clip_z}), reducing the color correlation between channels, which also reduce pixel intensity influence over the model.
