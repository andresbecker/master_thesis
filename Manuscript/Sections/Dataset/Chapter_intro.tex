The objective of this work is to predict \gls{tr} using spacial information contained in cell images. So, how can we describe/predict the \gls{tr}? And the answer is through antibodies.

This part should contain:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Recap of what is the aim of this work.
  \item Why multiplexed protein maps can be used.
  \item A small overview. Explain roughly the pipline: Preprocessing -> TDFS -> CNN
\end{itemize}
