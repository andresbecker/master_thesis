% A small motivation to create Multiplexed Protein Maps
The amount of protein or \gls{mrna} inside a cell may not be enough to fully describe cellular function. Accordingly to Buxbaum et al. \cite{Buxbaum_2014} and Korolchuk et al. \cite{Korolchuk2011}, cellular function can heavily depends on the specific intracellular location and interaction with other molecules and intracellular structures. Therefore, cellular expression is determined by the functional state, abundance, morphology, and turnover of its intracellular organelles and cytoskeletal structures. This means that having the ability to look at the concentration and distribution of different molecules within a cell, is an important technological achievement that can significantly leverage scientific discoveries in biomedicine.
This is exactly what \gls{mpm} allows us to do (\cite{Guteaar7042}). \gls{mpm} are protein readouts from cell cultures, that simultaneously captures different properties of the cell, like its shape, cycle state, detailed morphology of organelles, nuclear subcompartments, etc. It also captures highly multiplexed subcellular protein maps, which can be used to identify functionally relevant single-cell states, like \gls{tr}. These maps can also identify new cellular states and allow quantitative comparisons of intracellular organization between single cells in different cell cycle states, microenvironments, and drug treatments \cite{Guteaar7042}.

So, let us explain more in deept what are these \gls{mpm}. Accordingly to Gabriele Gut et al. \cite{Guteaar7042}, \gls{mpm} is a nondegrading protocol that allows to capture efficiently thousands of single cell multichannel images, where each channel contains the distribution and concentration of a protein of interest inside each cell. To achieve this, the protocol is made up of different steps that will be briefly explained here.

% 4i explanation
\subsubsection{Iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging}
The \gls{mpm} protocol starts with a process called \gls{4i} developed by the same group. The \gls{4i} is a complete protocol by itself, and it allows to capture the concentration and distribution of individual proteins in thousands of different cells in a tissue\footnote{The tissues were made from cell cultures using the \hl{HeLa Kyoto} \hl{184A1} cell line. HeLa is the oldest and most commonly used immortal human cell line in scientific research. The story behind it is quite interesting, so it's worth checking out.}.
Before applying the \gls{4i} protocol, the \hl{plate} where the cell culture is must be divided into squared sections called \hl{wells}. Then, the \gls{4i} protocol is applied over each well and photographed in sections called \hl{sites}.

Roughly speaking, \gls{4i} works as follow
\begin{enumerate}
  % 1
  \item The selected well is prepared for the staining-elution process.
  %2
  \item The well is saturated with a liquid containing \hl{antibodies}\footnote{An antibody is a Y-shaped protein that can recognize and bind to a unique molecule (its antigen, e.g. another protein).} stained with a fluorescent ink (\gls{if}), which binds to a target protein.
  %3
  \item The well is exposed to a high-energy light and photographed using a light microscopy (which produces a single channel image).
  %4
  \item The antibodies inside the tissue are washed-out using a chemical elution substrate.
  %5
  \item Steps 2 to 4 are repeated 20 times to get 20 images of the same protein.
  %6
  \item To improve the protein readouts, the 20 single channel images are projected into one by \hl{maximum intensity projection}.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:4i:1} illustrates the steps of the \gls{4i} protocol that capture the saturation and distribution of a specific protein. Keep in mind that even though the \gls{4i} protocol captures sever images of the tissue, it returns an uni-channel image (step 6). Figure \ref{fig:4i:2} shows the \gls{4i} protocol applied 40 times with different \gls{if} and over a 384-well plate, which captures the concentration and distribution of 40 different specific proteins.

  \label{fig:4i}
\end{figure}

By the time \cite{Guteaar7042} was published, the \gls{4i} protocol was able to capture cell culture images with up to 40 channels without degrading the tissue, which is why \gls{mpm} is called a \textit{nondegrading} protocol.

\subsubsection{Multiplexed single cell analysis}

Once the multichannel images were generated using the \gls{4i} protocol, a series of image preprocessing and image analysis methods (\cite{Carpenter2006} and \cite{snijder2012single}) are applied to generate segmentation masks to identify individual cells, as well as their cytoplasm and nucleus. Figure \ref{fig:4i:2} shows this segmentation at a cellular level, while figure \ref{fig:4i:segmentation} shows it also at a subcellular level. In both cases the boundaries are marked with a white contour. This single cell analysis is also used to identify cells that do not satisfy certain quality controls (like cells in the border of the image or in mitosis stage). However, this will be addressed in detail on section \ref{sec:dataset:data_pp}.

The number next to each staining label indicates their corresponding 4i acquisition cycle (\gls{4i} protocol step 5). The orange rectangle and the tile at its right shows a section of the nucleus and cytoplasm of a single cell. The other 3 tiles shows the \gls{4i} readout of each of the 3 proteins.

\subsubsection{Cell cycle phase classification: $G_1,\ S,\ G_2$ and $M$ phase}

The \gls{mpm} protocol is not only capable to capture the concentration and distribution of molecules inside thousands of cells. It can also identify the phase each cell is in, which is tightly related with the abundances and distribution of molecules inside a cell \cite{Guteaar7042}.

Roughly speaking, cell cycle phase was determined by means of a \gls{svm} classifier and k-means clustering. First, a \gls{svm} classifier is trained to identify $M$ phase cells based on the nuclear information in one of the image channels (\hl{DAPI}\footnote{A brief description of this marker can be found on section \ref{sec:appendix:if_markers}.}). Then, based on the nuclear information of channel \hl{PCNA}, a second \gls{svm} classifier is trained to identify cells in phase $S$. Finally, cells in phase $G_1$ and $G_2$ are classified using a k-means algorithm, using the pixel intensity profiles of the DAPI channels excluding the cells in $S$ and $M$ phase. A more detailed explanation of the cell cycle classification process can be found on the dataset paper \cite{Guteaar7042}.

\subsubsection{Multiplexed protein maps experimental setup}

Although the data used for this work were generated largely following the \gls{mpm} protocol, they are not the same as those shown in \cite{Guteaar7042}.
We warmly thank \textbf{Scott Berry} from Pelkmans Lab (at the University of Zurich), for providing the data for this work.

As we already mentioned, the \gls{mpm} protocol is capable of capturing up to 40 different proteins and molecules within a cell nucleus using fluorescent markers.
The \gls{mpm} data provided for this work contains 38 channels, .i.e. readouts of 38 different proteins and molecules. Table \ref{table:tfds_in:channels} in appendix \ref{sec:appendix:tfds}, shows the marker used for each channel. Table \ref{table:apendix:if_markers} (appendix \ref{sec:appendix:if_markers}), shows an explanation of some of these markers.

As we mentioned on section \ref{ch:literature_review}, the \gls{mpm} protocol also include the use of pharmacological and metabolic perturbations to some sections of the cell culture. However, this work focused on cells without those perturbations. This means that only cells marked as \hl{normal} (no perturbed cells) and \hl{DMSO}\footnote{Dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSO, is an organic compound used to dissolve test compounds in in drug discovery and design \cite{cushnie2020bioprospecting}.} (control cells) were used.

As mentioned in this section, the \gls{4i} protocol is applied to cell cultures, which are divided into rectangular sections called \hl{wells}. The results shown in chapter \ref{ch:results} were obtained using the cells belonging to wells \hl{J16, I14, J10, I09, I11} and \hl{J12}, which also correspond to the unperturbed and control cells (\hl{normal} and \hl{DSMO}). These wells provided a total of 3,703 cells.

Recall that one of the objectives of this work is to fit a model capable of estimating the \gls{tr} of a cell, given a snapshot of it at a specific moment of time.
However, the \gls{tr} is not provided directly with the \gls{mpm} data.
Instead, for each cell its \gls{tr} is calculated by averaging the measured pixels corresponding to the marker \hl{EU} (in or case channel 35, see tables \ref{table:tfds_in:channels} and \ref{table:apendix:if_markers}).
Marker \texttt{EU} contains nuclear readouts of nascent RNA molecules (\gls{pmrna}) in a given period of time. For the data provided, this time period is 30 minutes, and is the same for all the cells.
