\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:Conclusion}
%% ==================

Nothing new here, only a short recap of the project, it's results, as well as possible future work.

%Future work
As future work, it would be interesting to explore other interpretability  methods or go more in-depth with the current one by, for instance, exploring different baseline for \acrlong{ig} and analyzing their impact on the importance maps.


Hannah's recommendations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Summarise previous chapters and list main results
  \item Depending on which suits your project better, you can also do the discussion in this chapter instead of in the results chapter
  \item Last paragraph of the discussion should include important outlook with future impact.
\end{itemize}
