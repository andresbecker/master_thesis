% Aqui respondes la pregunta, por que cell images? por que spatial information?

Understanding how RNA concentration in eukaryotes cells is regulated is very important to understand gene expression. Measuring the amount of RNA inside a cell, may not be enough to fully describe cellular function. Accordingly to Buxbaum et al. \cite{Buxbaum_2014} and Korolchuk et al. \cite{Korolchuk2011}, cellular function can heavily depends on the specific intracellular location and interaction with other molecules and intracellular structures. Therefore, the use of models capable of focusing on the spatial information contained in cell images, can potentially help us to understand cell expression.
