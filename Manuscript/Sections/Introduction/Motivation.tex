Understanding how RNA concentration in eukaryotes cells is regulated is very important to understand gene expression. However, measuring the amount of RNA inside a cell, may not be enough to fully describe cellular function. Accordingly to Buxbaum et al. \cite{Buxbaum_2014} and Korolchuk et al. \cite{Korolchuk2011}, cellular function can heavily depend on the specific intracellular location and interaction with other molecules and intracellular structures.
According to Vogel et al. \cite{vogel2010sequence}, explaining gene expression using only nuclear protein abundance can be done only until a certain extent.

In recent years the development of new methods for capturing spatial organization and distribution of several subnuclear bodies and proteins/molecules in high resolution images \cite{Guteaar7042}, makes the use of \gls{cnn} models to analyze this information a natural choice. As \glspl{cnn} have proven to be powerful tools in the recognition of spatial patterns \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}.
The use of \glspl{cnn} not only would allow us to estimate gene expression. The continuous development of interpretability methods \cite{hooker2018benchmark}, would also allow us to understand how these models work and learn from them.

For these reasons, the use of models capable of focusing on subnuclear spatial information, can potentially help us to understand better cell expression.
