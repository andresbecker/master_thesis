This dir contains the parameters files used to train the models showed in the final Thesis document. BL correspond to the "Simple CNN" model, RN to the "ResNet50V2" and XC to the "Xception". Each dir contains to parameters files which are almost identical. The only difference is that the first one train a model using using per-channel color randomization (Random_channel_intencity=1), and the second one don't (Random_channel_intencity=0).
